# Part 1

I created a private repo with the default name git-experiments and in VSCode, run "git clone https://github.com/tccuong8/git-experiments.git" , but my collaborator, Albert, already did the same with someone he helped as a collaborator, so I renamed the repo to cuongs-git-experiments. We then both run "https://github.com/tccuong8/cuongs-git-experiments.git", and the cloning succeeded.

I then made an "addition.txt" on VSCode, git add it, then git commit with "Add proof of git skill" as the message, and git push it. Albert run git pull and confirmed that he got the file, and then both checked out the git repo and confirmed that the new file has appeared there too. I then edited the README.md file directly in GitHub, preemptively writing here that I would add-commit-push it with the message "Rewrite README", plus sending it on the slack channel.

As I write this, I realized I would need to make the repo public, and so I preemptively write here that I'll also make the repo public. I forgot to write that I would actually make the repo public rather than just writing about it here, so I pushed this hopefully last sentence with another edit of the README.md file to confirm that I'd do so.

After converting the repo to public, I realized I forgot to write that I'd send its link to the class Slack channel, so here it is, and here's confirming that I do actually plan to do that too.
